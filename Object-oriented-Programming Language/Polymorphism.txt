polymorphism: Ploy means many and Morphism means forms. Many forms
A single method can many forms

There are two types of polymorphism
1. Compile Time polymorphism
2. Run Time polymorphism


Compile Time polymorphism: 
Compile Time polymorphism is also know as Static polymorphism can be achieved via Method Overloading 

Method Overloading: 
Method should be in same name of method
Method should be in same class
Method should have : 
    1. Different Number Arguments
    2. Different Sequence of Argument
    3. Different type of Argument


Run Time polymorphism:
Run Time polymorphism is also known as Dynamic Polymorphism  and can be achieved via Method Overriding

Method Overriding:
Methods Should same name
Methods should be different class
Methods should have: 
    1. Same number of Argument
    2. Same Sequence of Argument
    3. Same type Argument
To achieve method overriding, There should be inheritanc(IS-A) relation ship between two classes.
class Parentclass{
    void display(){
        //No argument method
        
    }
}

class Childclass extends Parent class{
    void display(){
        //No argument method same as parent class
        //We can modify parent class implementation here
    }
}
