Defination:  A class is a user defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created. It represents the set of properties or methods that are common to all objects of one type.

Class is not a real world entity. It is just a template or blueprint or prototype from which objects are created.
Class does not occupy memory.
Class is a group of variables of different data types and group of methods.

A class in java can contain:
• data member
• method
• constructor
• nested class
• interface


Class keyword: class keyword is used to create a class. 
Class name: The name should begin with an initial letter (capitalized by convention).


IN Java, classes and interfaces themselves can have only two access modifiers when declared outside any other class. 
1) public 
2) default (when no access modifier is specified)

Note: Nested interfaces and classes can have all access modifiers.
Note: We cannot declare class/interface with private or protected access modifiers.

Example
//filename: Main.java
protected class Test {}

public class Main {
public static void main(String args[]) {

}
}
